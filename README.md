Our semester project will be a website which will allow users to learn something about the apartments. This website will also provide functionalities for leasing office to manage and update the information. People used to rely on walking in the leasing office to learn some news about the community. Because of the coronavirus, many people are inconvenient to go out. Therefore, we set up this website to help the front desk, residents and people who are interested in living here
